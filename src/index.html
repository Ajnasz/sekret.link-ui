          <p class="text-sm"><strong>Attention!</strong> The message can be read only once! After it's read, the message will be destroyed and can not be restored.<br>
			  Also note that <strong>if you send the link through an application which provides preview of websites, it may</strong> tries to download and create preview for this link as well by fetcing the URL. It means that this third party tool will <strong>read and destroy the secret</strong>. To pervent it, it's suggested to <strong>use the JavaScript enabled version of the application</strong> which can address this issue with add some additional mechanism.</p>
